# Overview

This app is a dice rolling app. There are two screens that one can switch between by pressing the button in the top righthand corner. 

On the first screen, there are multiple types of dice. A user to press each of those buttons to increase the amount of dice that will be rolled. They can press any different type of dice, and any number of those dice. The number and type of dice that will be rolled are displayed above the roll button. Once satisfied with the number of dice being rolled, the user can press the roll button. A number is displayed near the top of the screen with the total resulting roll. For those who are not familiar, the dice are labeled according to convention. The first number indicates the quantity of dice. It is followed by a "d", which stands for "dice" or "die". The last number indicates the number of faces that the dice has. For example, "2d20" means that there are two dice that are twenty-sided. 

On the second screen, there is a roll button. Once pressed, 10 six-sided dice are rolled and 10 results are displayed. This is useful for games which use many six-sided dice, such as liar's dice, tenzi, and yatzee. The user can continue pressing the roll button to recieve new results. 

I created this app as a way to learn how to create apps, as well as become familiar with Kotlin. While it was different than what I am familiar with, I was suprised by how starightforward it could be. 

Below is a link to a YouTube video where I walk through my code and demonstrate my app.

# Development Environment

I wrote this software in Kotlin, a language that I had not known before starting this project. I used Android Studio to write the code. I also utilized ChatGPT to learn example syntax without having to spend time searching for it. This was an incredible help that really streamlined the process of creating this app.

# Future Work

* Include a button on the screen with the 10 six-sided dice to allow the user to remove dice, as well as a button to reset.
* Change the shapes of the dice that are different types to reflect the type of dice.
* On the screen with the different types of dice, display the result of each roll as well as the sum of those results, instead of displaying just the sum.
